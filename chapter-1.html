									<p>"What must I do to inherit eternal life?"</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/ch-1/1-rose.jpg" alt="a stained glass window with elements in concentric circles around the center" /></div>
								<p><i>By James Warwood, Brandee Easter, and Christa J. Olson</i></p>
								<p>In this famous question recounted in the Christian Gospels of Luke and Mark, a rich man asks Jesus—the Gospels’ main character—to serve as a teacher in both political and religious life. The man, and by extension, the Gospels’ readers, ask what they must do in order to achieve the right ends (eternal life). And Jesus, in response, offers a vision for the good of community life. He advises, as Aristotle might put it, “about future happenings” offering exhortations about the “better course” by which the man can reach his goal (<i>On Rhetoric</i> Book 1, Chapter 3, para 2 and 5; page 48, 49).</p>
								<p>A millennium after the Christian Gospels were written, their followers pursued the rich man’s question as a pedagogical and religious imperative. How, medieval Christian leaders asked, do we instruct the masses in what is right? How do we teach them what to do in this life such that they may achieve eternal life? In responding to those questions, religious leaders engaged what rhetoricians would call deliberative forms, both exhortative and dissuasive. They sought to move congregations toward what they understood to be the “advantageous” and away from what they saw as “harmful” to the future of the community (<i>On Rhetoric</i> Book 1, Chapter 3, para 2 and 5; page 48, 49). Though verbal preaching and teaching were a primary means of such preparation for eternal life during the medieval period and into the early modern, religious pedagogy also took visual and spatial form. As grand monasteries and churches came to be central sites of Christian religious practice in late medieval Europe, their stained glass windows became part of that effort. </p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/ch-1/1-sun.jpg" alt="Photograph of warm orange light shining through a stained glass window" /></div>
								<p>Sun shining through colored glass washed worship spaces in vibrant light and set biblical stories aglow. Stained glass helped guide viewers in pursuing the good (as their leaders understood it). Medieval rhetoricians regularly treated this religious work (especially spoken words and written texts) in terms allied with Aristotle’s first rhetorical paradigm: the deliberative. They approached some kinds of religious pedagogy and preaching as akin to policy speech in the public forum, as rhetorical visions for what ought to be done to secure the future good of the community. Indeed, in medieval and early modern Europe, Christian religious venues were a primary site for such hegemonic deliberation (Conley 1994). Outlining the deliberative function of the visual in “On Visual Rhetoric,” we return to those religious contexts to uncover what they reveal about visual deliberation more broadly and what they show us about how a deliberative framework can obscure key aspects of the persuasive work done by communication deemed to be public, political, and future-oriented.</p>
								<p>In the millenia since the authors of the Greek New Testament drew extensively on Aristotelian theories to frame their appeals to the early Christian church (S. Olson 1976), the study of rhetoric has become increasingly secular. Though until at least the mid-19th century, rhetorical education in Europe and the United States regularly had ties to religious education and professions, today it may seem strange to begin a discussion of deliberative rhetoric with a theological question. After all, in the contemporary United States, deliberation is associated with civic and political life, and the separation of church and state is powerfully definitive. However, as numerous rhetorical scholars have shown, that strictly secular orientation is historically recent and, even today, leaves a great deal of deliberative activity out of the picture (Camper 2020; Johnson 2012; Mountford 2003). It also, notably, whitens the history of deliberative rhetoric in the United States (Diab 2016; Holmes 2017; Johnson and Stone 2018). For our purposes, we find that turning to the now unfamiliar realm of sacred deliberation helps us better illustrate the deliberative functions of the visual and reveal the biases, tensions, and omissions that accompany an over-emphasis on deliberation as the primary rhetorical paradigm for public decision making.</p>
								<p>Rhetoricians rooting their work in Greco-Roman traditions have long celebrated the work of deliberation. Its focus on public discussion of policy and right futures has helped grant rhetorical studies (and, later, the study of visual rhetoric) legitimacy. This sense that deliberation enhanced rhetoric’s moral standing has ancient roots: Aristotle suggested that Athenian teachers of oratory were too focused on forensic skills, and argued that deliberative rhetoric was a more noble venue for rhetoric. For a long time, this sense that deliberative rhetoric was particularly virtuous stuck with the Euro-American study of rhetoric. It shaped the genres of speech and the contexts that rhetoricians most studied: the pulpit, the political stage, and the halls of power; the sermon, the treatise, and the inaugural address. Even though rhetoricians today are less likely to privilege deliberation than were our predecessors, our choices are still marked by that long history. The study of visual rhetoric is no exception.</p>
								<p>Some of the earliest scholarship on visual rhetoric tackled the question, “Can pictures be arguments?”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p> 
								<p>That question, and the answers provided, set the stage for understanding pictures as deliberative — as helping audiences engage in the work of proposing directions, building consensus, and making decisions about public life. Treating images that circulated in both formal, legislative contexts and in the agora of everyday life, visual rhetoric scholars still frequently imagine pictures as rhetorical because of the way they’re used to frame decisions and direct common futures.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
								<p>In the process, visual rhetoric scholarship tends to assume that viewers can and must be taught how to see properly in order to be proper citizens. Every time rhetoricians present pictures as carrying information about public life and demanding reflection on how an imagined “we” ought to proceed, we engage with the deliberative function of the visual. Contemporary visual rhetoric scholarship on political advertising, citizenship, classroom pedagogy, and (in some cases) documentary photography all imagine the rhetoricity of the visual in terms of how it engages viewers in reflection and conversation about how they ought to approach their life in common: what decisions they ought to make and what forms of action they ought to pursue. And, as we have already noted, that orientation goes back a long way.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/ch-1/1-chartres.jpg" alt="Photograph inside Chartres cathedral facing the altar" /></div>
								<p>We turn, then, to the 12th century cathedral in the town of Chartes, France and its visual deliberations caught in stained glass. Construction began on the now iconic cathedral in 1145 and continued for hundreds of years. It famously features a wide array of stained-glass windows dating from the 12th and 13th centuries. Gazing at one of those windows and its depiction of the story of Noah and the Ark alongside images of medieval public life, we offer a “reading” of how its scenes enact deliberative functions of the visual and we note how a deliberative orientation allows us to examine visual rhetoric as pedagogical, future-oriented, and concerned with crafting publics. To close the chapter, we will leave France and travel across the Atlantic, following Christian pedagogues turned conquistadors. There, in another venue of Christian, Catholic visual pedagogy, we will highlight the violence, destruction, and distinction that deliberation’s forward-moving, rationality-driven framework both entails and occludes.</p>

									<p>Stained glass, as a deliberative and educational project, developed through centuries as towns grew up around monasteries. Although monasteries began as centers of religious education that were closed to the laity, they eventually became sites of pilgrimage. Out of a desire to reach the laity, the “educated clergy” developed stained glass programs specifically for a lay audience. In particular, this was done through the representation of secular miracles—i.e. the parables—and a typology—the paralleling of Old Testament prototypes with Christian events—creating a standard, recognizable imagery. A group of pilgrims guided by a monk or priest would walk through the monastery church gazing up at the scenes above them as the guide would narrate the parables. His words would not only describe the pictures, but animate their purpose and invite the lay public to interact with their meanings (Raguin 2013, 67, 77-9).</p>
									<p>As towns grew up around the monasteries and parish churches joined the monastery churches, stained glass appeared there too, but this time intended from the beginning to communicate with a lay audience. The scenes depicted were simple and easily followed. Themes were drawn from the education of the laity, showing specific, practical actions for moral instruction (120-1). Though the cathedral at Chartes was no ordinary parish church, many of its stained glass windows carried forward this project of religious pedagogy. In window after window, the right action of Biblical figures and the right action of the local congregation intertwined, setting models to emulate.</p>
									<p>Stained glass windows, like all Medieval religious art, were, Raguin suggests, intended to “offer the viewer a locus of transcendence” (70). In the beginning, when it was offered to religious insiders, this visual transcendence happened parallel to but distinct from religious education, which was largely offered through textual study. As lay audiences became the intended audience, however, transcendence and pedagogy entwined. Stained glass trained lay viewers—ubiquitously understood as illiterate, uneducated, and simple—in the ways of faith and the direction their lives ought to take. The windows weren’t meant to replace verbal bible readings. Instead, they were designed to illustrate the words of spoken or memorized biblical stories and “encourage reflection, through multiple viewings, on timeless truths in the same manner that a text could be read again and again with ever deepening—and differing—results" (87). Stained glass windows, in other words, were a powerful element within the performative, interactive liturgical space of the church. They pointed worshipers toward ways of life that were in line with the expectations of church doctrine and aimed toward the good of the larger community (as understood by its leaders). They were imagined to literally and metaphorically “repel the wind and rain” from the church and the viewer (Kessler 2019, 143).</p>
									<p>Viewing stained glass through a deliberative lens illuminates this normative, hierarchical soul-focused instruction. Through it, we can recognize stained glass as part of a broader pedagogical, rhetorical ecology that aimed to shape thought, action, and interaction. We can also see that stained glass had designs not only on the faith and moral action of individual viewers, but also on their imbrication within larger structures and practices, their role within a Chrisitan community. The window at the heart of our analysis is exemplary of this deliberative orientation. The biblical scenes depicted in Chartres Bay 47 show Noah embodying the right behavior of a believer. In them, Noah listens to God’s call, labors at the task set before him even when others doubt, and is ultimately rewarded with God’s promise and favor symbolized in the rainbow. Viewers had to know the story already or listen to it in the moment in order to understand the proffered scenes. But once the story was familiar, the windows could guide viewers through it again and again and remind them of the story’s message of faith.</p>

										</div>
									</div>
									<p>Scenes of everyday life are an unusual but important feature of the stained glass windows at Chartres. Beneath images of God, saints, and biblical narratives, scenes of tradespeople appear in the bottom panels of the lower-story windows throughout the cathedral. In total, there are over 125 illustrations of tradespeople in at least 25 different occupations, including bakers, money changers, furriers, and masons (Williams 1993).</p>
									<p>Although the trade windows and the more traditional parable scenes throughout the church are not consistently related, one way they interact is by repeating content or imagery from the trade scenes within the biblical scenes above them. In Bay 47, axes appear in the hands of carpenters, wheelwrights, and Noah building the ark. The barrels being tightened by a cooper are also used by Noah’s sons making wine. This repetition draws an alignment between biblical stories and the everyday labor of medieval viewers. Their work and production was imbued with spiritual motivations and outcomes. These analogies communicate the value of work by aligning everyday obedience to one’s responsibilities with the labor asked of well-known biblical figures. They use labor to provide continuity between the faith enacted in biblical times and in Medieval viewers’ own time. These images are straight-forwardly pedagogical, and in a deliberative vein, linking right behavior in everyday work to the enactment of a godly life.</p>
									<p>The deliberative, future imagining work done by those trade scenes cannot be fully understood without the context in which they were built. Although some scholars see these windows as evidence of a friendly relationship between the church and town—some even suggest that the windows represent donations made by the trade guilds depicted in them—others argue that there is little historical basis for such a relationship (Williams 1993). Instead, the latter scholars suggest, resolving social conflict was an essential motivation for the windows. Conflict over power and competition for income between the town’s count, bishop, canons, and townspeople was the reality of Chartres in the 13th century. Created during times of riots and violence, these windows imagine and propose a different future in line with the political-religious aims of the Catholic Church: one in which tradespeople and publics contributed to the work of the Church and through this behavior, moved toward salvation.</p>
									<p>In this sense, the windows are particularly deliberative. Rather than praising existing conditions, they propose a vision for proper Christian polity going forward. Thus, the close relationship between Church and public that appears in the windows through repeated imagery and close proximity can be understood not as a celebration of what is, but as a deliberative proposal for what ought to be. Seen through a deliberative lens, these sacred pictures in colored glass, like the more secular images often discussed by rhetoricians, intervene in the formation of public opinion and carry arguments about public life and policy (Asen 2002; Barbatsis 2018; Finnegan 2003; Parry-Giles 2010). Looking at the windows in this way, rhetoricians recognize how the visual establishes parameters—the scope, nature, and import of a public issue—and make assertions on how to best proceed.</p>

									<p>Stained glass was not simply an illustration for text-based teaching about how to proceed with public life. The work of instructing the public and their souls was understood as inextricable from teaching the senses. Stained glass did more than instruct viewers about the stories they were seeing. They also taught them <i>how</i> to look and see. Such an education of the senses (including but not limited to vision) was a high-stakes concern because—at the time—sensory perception was understood as the first step toward thinking, doing, and being (Newhauser 2018). Without the proper instruction on how to perceive, the senses could lead away from the promise of eternal life. Vision in particular was seen as morally precarious—the eyes being closely linked with the soul and with the potential for “wandering eyes” that threaten to “infect” the viewer morally (8). Thus, sensation was not only “guarded, but guided,” and stained glass, as well as sermons, played a role in such an education (9).</p>
									<p>The Noah’s arc window at Chartes usefully illustrates how deliberative visual pedagogies tap into the sensorial risk and possibility at work in medieval visual theory. There are 40 separate scenes depicted within the window, and they follow an order that is instructive beyond conveying narrative structure. To “read” the story, viewers would begin by looking in the bottom left corner, moving their eyes to panels first from left to right and then upward. The story then continues on the row above, again moving left to right. As viewers moved their eyes up along the panel, they also elevated their understanding and their affiliations. The scenes bordering the central panels shift from tradespeople to divine beings. Viewers would see not carpenters but angels. The organization of the panels, in other words, did more than walk viewers through a story. It also drew ordinary eyes toward the divine, lifting them into the proper place of devotion and adoration. Physically looking upward toward the divine was one way that both sermons and stained glass directed viewers away from immoral “naval-gazing” (Meussig 2018, 20). Instead, the glass taught them where to direct their vision in order to seek eternal life.</p>
									<p>In this way, these windows show that the deliberative function concerns more than instructions about what to do in public life about particular issues. It also can instruct the act of seeing itself. Such a “pedagogy of sight” as enacted by the windows has been recognized by rhetoricians theorizing the deliberative function, showing how specific rhetorical strategies, both within and around images, instruct their readers how to see and interpret an image (Jack 2009). </p>
									<p>However, looking at religious imagery in this way—as training the senses for communal life—also points us toward political elements that the deliberative frame too easily elides. Over-emphasizing the deliberative function of the visual as a means of enacting political life (whether secular or sacred) risks romanticizing antagonistic power relations as instead agonistic and, in the process, treating domination, control, and violence as external to—or perversions of—Western political traditions. Yet, as the history of the Christian church in the early modern period reminds us, Christian religious education, particularly when turned toward conversion, used deliberative means for deadly ends.</p>

									<h2><a href="#">Deliberate Violence</a></h2>

									<div class="image main"><img src="images/ch-1/1-quito.jpg" alt="A photograph of the Church and Convent of San Francisco in Quito, Ecuador, a long white stucco building with a stone facade at the center and a stone plaza in front, outlined by a bright, light blue sky" /></div>
									<p>The deliberative mode, as envisioned by Aristotle and transmitted over centuries by rhetoricians of various inclinations, carries with it a problematic presumption: that there is actually common decision-making happening and that the people affected are the ones engaged in the process of debating policy. Now, rhetoricians have long recognized that presumption as a fiction (Fraser 1990, 2007). We know that in Aristotle’s time the “demos” (people) of democracy was a highly restricted group. In Athens, citizenship belonged only to free men and only to those free men born within the limited space of the Athenian polis. Democracies ever since have all been restricted in their own ways, and the notion that the people are able to come together to deliberate their future remains not just an unrealized ideal but a situation actively evaded by those holding power. Theories of the public sphere, likewise, have drawn attention to the crucial question of who gets to participate in the negotiation of public life, though they often maintain an optimism unwarranted by history (see, for example, Nancy Fraser’s (2007) concerns about the efficacy of public opinion within a transnational public sphere).</p>
									<p>Although it is possible to use a deliberative frame while attending carefully to inequity, violence, and the workings of power, the frame was not designed for such analyses and as such is not well-adapted for them. Rhetoricians addressing the deliberative function of the visual must torque the deliberative frame and include caveats and counterpoints in order to insert an awareness of power. The fact that such conscientious correction is necessary tells us that the deliberative frame, while useful, cannot be the only available rhetorical function of the visual through which we understand how people negotiate public life and confront political decision making.</p>
									<p>The stained glass in Chartes Cathedral, with its idealized relationships between church and town, could illustrate many of those shortcomings accompanying over-reliance on deliberative models. As we have suggested (parenthetically) numerous times above, the pedagogy of public life shown in Chartes’ windows came from the top down even as it encouraged congregants to look up toward the divine. Religious leaders imagined what the common laity must do to inherit eternal life (and, in the process, provide for the wealth of the church on Earth). There was no room for true deliberation. The good life together, as proposed in the windows, was life imagined in the interests of the few on the backs of the many. We turn, however, to the Christian colonial enterprise—particularly the rhetorical history of Spanish colonial conversion practices—because that context more fully reveals how a deliberative frame not only facilitates lack of attention to violence and inequity but actively elides such violence, coloring conquest and murder in the hues of future salvation.</p>
									<p>The earliest rhetoric textbook written both for and from within the Spanish colonial context is Diego Valadés’s <i>Rhetorica Christiana,</i> published in 1579 (illustration from page 111, pictured below). Valadés, son of a Spanish father and a Tlaxcalan mother, received his initial education in the midst of colonial choque—at the first European schools founded in what had been Mexica territory. He was admitted to the Franscican order in the mid-1500s and continued his education at religious schools, coming to identify fully with his father’s heritage and the colonial project. “In his writing,” Abbott notes, “Valadés never identifies with the [Indigenous people he writes about]; they are always Indians, always the other” (45). Valadés’s textbook and subsequent rhetorics developed by the Spanish colonial project were tools of conversion. To the extent that they sought to understand Indigenous ways of being and knowing, it was always in service of more effectively wrenching Indigenous people away from those ways. These rhetorics helped subsequent missionaries joining colonial religious orders learn how to preach the gospel to the “heathen” masses of New Spain, and they presumed to teach “what must be done to inherit eternal life” in deliberative fashion, “urging [‘Indians’ toward] the better [i.e. Christian] course and … dissuading [them from that which was] worse” (i.e. their own vibrant and sustainable ways of life) (<i>On Rhetoric</i> Book 1, Chapter 3, para 5, page 49).</p>
									<div class="box alt">

											<div class="col-3"></div>
											<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ch-1/1-valdes2.jpg" alt="An engraving showing a large crowd of Indigenous people gazing at a man in friar's robes who preaches from a raised puplit, pointing to drawings of the Christian story of the cruxificion" /></span><p><i>A missionary, possibly Peter of Ghent, preaching to a Mexica audience with the aid of illustrated screens. The text reads: "The teacher adapts the heavenly gifts to the senses, wetting parched souls with his eloquence."</i></p></div>
											<div class="col-3"></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>Such education, for Valadés, drew on the principles of religious instruction available in Europe, and his <i>Rhetorica Christiana</i> took up and extended the blend of visual and verbal elements already in use there. Lacking the infrastructure for stained glass, his ideal preacher used painted screens to narrate Biblical stories and draw the Mexica, the Tlaxcalans, and their neighbors toward Christian polity. Later years brought elaborate festivals and parades that not only performed epideictic functions—which we discuss more in <a href="chapter-3.html">Chapter 3</a>—but deliberative ones. They modeled an idealized polity of authority and acquiescence bound together through submission to the dictates of faith. As Diana Taylor and Max Harris have each demonstrated, Spanish colonial authorities never intended the Indigenous peoples of what became known as New Spain to take equal part in deliberations over the idealized colonial, Christian polity (Harris 2000; Taylor 2003, 41-50). Those communities, however, were not to be denied. The norms and expectations of the deliberative are less than useful for understanding how—through religious performance, syncretism, appropriation, and adaptation—the Mexica and other Indigenous groups of colonial New Spain engaged in picturing public futures. Sidestepping deliberation, they modulated, refused, overwrote, and undercut the models of life together thrust upon them by colonizers who thought they held a monopoly on truth and the means of persuasion.</p>
									<p>We hope that, at this point, readers begin to see the shortcomings of a deliberative frame for understanding the rhetorical functions of the visual in these sacred, colonial settings. Because the deliberative frame requires contexts where decision-making and political options are put forth, it prioritizes spaces of power and the people holding that power. We can, in a deliberative mode, critique the visions developed by Valadés and the political and religious authorities of colonial New Spain, but we also must acquiesce to having those authorities at the center of public life in order to enact that critique. Especially in a context like that of New Spain, where the colonial archive is generally presumed to have obliterated or mediated all possibility of direct knowledge about pre-Colombian Indigenous life, the deliberative frame focuses visual rhetoricians’ lenses on pictures produced by and for the powerful, even when they also carry critical, anti-colonial purposes. Deliberation, as a way of knowing and way of being, belongs to the colonial enterprise. Emphasizing it risks obscuring the violence of that enterprise.</p>
