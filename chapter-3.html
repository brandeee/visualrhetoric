									<h1>Making<br />
									Common Sight</h1>
									<p>“A picture is worth a thousand words” is perhaps today’s best-known cliché about visual objects. It also encapsulates numerous assumptions about the rhetorical functions of the visual.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

								<p>We start with it here not because we buy the cliché but because its ubiquity in U.S. visual vernacular tells us a great deal about how people [in the United States, at least] perceive the rhetorical force of pictures. Because this chapter is about how shared sight links people to one another, beginning with a commonplace about sight helps illuminate the actual and presumed rhetorical functions of the visual for community building.</p>	
								<p>The cliché, “a picture is worth a thousand words,” emphasizes the indexical power of visual objects: This happened. This is real. A picture, in the cliché, is a truth claim, and looking at pictures is a mode of information gathering.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> The cliché, in other words, names witnessing as a primary rhetorical function of the visual. Apprehending what a picture shows, viewers enter into relationship with the subject matter and take on a sort of responsibility toward it. In this sense, both pictures and the process of seeing act on viewers via what the Greek rhetoricians called ekphrasis: vivid or lively description. Witnessing “brings before the eyes” what must be seen in order to be understood, acted upon, or made real. That belief that vision entails witnessing, and that witnessing carries obligation, power, and access to the real, are fundamental presumptions of Western visual culture.</p>
								<p>Now, obviously, that “witnessing” function of the visual could find a home in either of the two previous chapters, alongside the collections of visual functions we have categorized as deliberative and forensic. When documentary photographs are brought before decision-makers as pieces of evidence that demand policy action—a sort of “visual rhetoric event” that has inspired many articles and books about visual rhetoric<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>—they invite viewers to serve as witnesses toward both forensic and deliberative ends: By seeing, viewers are asked to indict what has happened, and, having been seen, the pictures then point toward necessary change. More fundamentally, however, the rhetorical function of the visual that is identified by “a picture is worth a thousand words” and that permeates much of Western visual practice is one that points toward some common reality and makes a claim on viewers in light of that now shared (because of having been seen) truth. Witnessing, as a key visual phenomenon, is, in this sense, an epideictic function of the visual. It is exemplary of the circumference-drawing work of rhetoric that ancient Greek rhetoricians described as speech of praise and blame.</p>
								<p>Rhetoricians (and visual culture scholars writing about what we would term the rhetorical functions of the visual) have found this epideictic function alluring even as we have cast doubt on the truth value of pictures. No visual scholar worth their salt would forget that pictures have always been infused with symbolism, manipulated, and falsified. A picture may be worth a thousand words, we shrug, but which thousand words? The image vernaculars of the late 20th and early 21st centuries make clear that scholars are not the only ones infused with skepticism; the prevalence of terms like photoshopping, filters, face swap, and deepfakes make clear that few if any of us are comfortable with the truth of the pictures around us.</p>

										</div>
									</div>
								<p>And yet, even the most skeptical of us are also affected by the visual activities that Margaret LaWare calls “witness[ing] the present” and places within the community-forming realm of the epideictic. Such visual engagement “illuminat[es] [a] community’s inherent reality,” LaWare (1999, 144) writes, and she names that community-forming, witness-driven function “visual epideictic.”  Scholars not explicitly invoking Aristotle’s term have likewise emphasized the role the visual plays in building up communities and establishing their borders—asking people to “bear witness to [their] historical legacy as well as [their] present” (147).<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>  LaWare’s initial elaboration of the visual’s epideictic function is celebratory: It focuses on how marginalized communities can use public display of cultural values as a tool for building solidarity. Subsequent scholarship in this vein (including LaWare’s own return to the same site a decade later) makes clear that identifications driven by witnessing can turn in other directions and that visual epideictic’s pictures of praise and blame are available for good and for ill.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> For this reason, rhetorical scholars continue to be fascinated by the slippery, untrustworthy, yet powerful rhetorical function of making common sight.</p>

								<p>Because, traditionally, the epideictic was separated from the institutional, productive functions of the polis—policy making <a href="chapter-1.html">(see Chapter 1)</a> and judicial determination <a href="chapter-2.html">(see Chapter 2)</a>—, it was long framed as the least necessary (and most disreputable) of the three Aristotelian branches. In the last several decades, however, rhetoricians have drawn attention to the generative potential of the epideictic, particularly—though not exclusively—in imperial contexts.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> Scholars of visual rhetoric have been particularly drawn to the epideictic, perhaps because of that function’s deep connection to witnessing practices and, thereby, to vision. While vision’s catalytic capacity might be the most celebrated function of the visual in existing rhetorical scholarship, community formation is its most readily agreed upon and frequently observed rhetorical function. Rhetoricians are repeatedly “sighting the public” and its discontents (Finnegan and Kang 2004). Pictures, images, and bodily presentation, we understand, are crucial to identification and circumference drawing. While Kenneth Burke’s original formulation of identification, “You persuade a man only insofar as you can talk his language by speech, gesture, tonality, order, image, attitude, idea, identifying your ways with his,” recenters identification on words (“talk his language”), the underlying action of identification in Burke’s formula leans heavily on visual means (gesture, order, image, attitude) (Burke 1950, 55). As rhetoricians of all stripes have increasingly turned to the ambient character of the rhetorical, the epideictic function has grown in prominence and importance, making it ripe for reevaluation.</p>
								<p>In this chapter, we identify the central features of the epideictic function of the visual and, in the process, show how a seductive yet problematic investment in vision’s indexical capacity both lends it cultural power—at least in the United States—and marks its ultimate limits for understanding the visual as a communal and community-building force. By looking to this “soft” and often maligned rhetorical function, we better understand how communities are created and sustained in visual structures. We also gain insight into how visuality offers distinct possibilities for counterpublic resistance, community recentering, and self-making. However, we also demonstrate in this chapter that if viewers and visual scholars invest too deeply in epideictic frameworks as the means of community formation through vision, we risk over-emphasizing the role of individual image-makers and viewers, over-prioritize visual objects as sources of rhetorical power, and over-invest in boundary-drawing and backward looking as primary means of community creation. </p>
								<p>To illuminate both the primary features of the epideictic functions of the visual (establishing communal boundaries, imagining new possibilities, and staking [questionable] claims to truth) and their limits, we turn now from “pictures” in general to a particular genre of picture. Although murals, photographs, and memorials all have a rich history of rhetorical treatments emphasizing the epideictic,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> we focus here on a category of visual objects that literally (if abstractly) picture communities: political maps. Maps are powerful visual objects that seek to appear natural, inevitable, and yet are the product of a wide array of persuasive choices and argumentative moves (Barney 2014). Frequently, they contain a double “pedagogy of sight,” in that their technical elements actively teach readers how to view the map and then the map teaches viewers how to picture the place or community (Jack 2009). This dual process of witnessing, we believe, makes maps particularly telling visual objects for sketching the scope and the boundaries of the epideictic function of the visual.</p>
						  		<!--BAR: COVID MAP-->
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/ch-3/3-covid.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>When we began working on this chapter in 2018, we turned to maps because they were so dominant in our media landscapes. Electoral maps repeatedly went viral throughout the leadup and aftermath of the 2016 election, and they were already looming in 2018 midterm predictions.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> We suspected they would return for the 2020 election, which we hoped would keep this chapter’s case study relevant. We had no idea, as the COVID-19 pandemic erupted, that such visualizations would become part of our daily efforts to understand what is happening in our communities, how to talk about risk, and where to locate praise, blame, and responsibility.</p>
								<p>In the remainder of this chapter, we use discussion of maps and mapping to highlight three ways that studying epideictic functions helps rhetoricians understand the rhetorical force of the visual while also noting the shortcomings that emerge due to overreliance on that function. We begin with the most foundational and widely recognized insight on the visual epideictic: that—through it—rhetoricians are able to name the community-forming effects of shared looking and recognize the circumference drawing that establishes the community’s limits and exclusions. Next, we grapple with the presumption of truth telling that underlies Western notions of “witnessing” and that hovers around the edges of the epideictic’s “speech of praise and blame.” Looking at political maps in the age of fake news and photoshopping, we frame the epideictic function of the visual as a site of conflict pitting the rhetorical against the real. Finally, we home in on a telling tension within rhetorical analyses adopting an epideictic framework, noting that while rhetoricians have sometimes presented the epideictic functions of the visual as making possible new forms of connection and power for marginalized communities, its underlying frameworks are normative. Despite “witnessing the present,” we suggest, the epideictic requires a “dorsal turn” to the past.</p>

									<h2>Who are we?</h2>

								<section>
									<p>During and after the 2016 presidential election, where Donald Trump’s virulent racism and misogyny, the possibilities and shortcomings of Hilary Clinton’s historic candidacy, and the fraught state of U.S. democracy itself were all regular topics of discussion, the epideictic task of showing the U.S. public to itself was both urgent and problematic. Pundits, journalists, and scholars regularly debated the best ways to treat Trump’s candidacy, particularly his most deplorable comments, and how to read the signs of misogyny and bias that dogged media coverage of Clinton.Who are we? Who ought we be? And What is wrong with those people?—all epideictic questions—were asked repeatedly, though not always in such explicit terms. The tools of visual epideictic showed viewers possible answers to all of them.</p>

									<p>On October 11, 2016, popular statistician and political commentator Nate Silver tweeted out a link to a story on FiveThirtyEight with the above left image captioned, “Here’s what the map would look line [sic] if only women voted.” The map is overwhelmingly blue, projecting 458 electoral votes for Clinton. Silver replied to this tweet with a counter image of the very red map above right, “if just dudes voted.” Although this kind of data (and even this kind of map) were not unusual in the months before the 2016 election, these two maps were particularly viral. They were retweeted over 20,000 times, picked up by several other outlets, and sparked over 500 derivative maps, both serious and satirical.</p>
									<p>In many ways, Silver’s “If Only X Voted” maps were unremarkable in the 2016 pre-election digital landscape. Pundits daily forecasted the results in new ways, hoping to isolate and account for various voting blocs. FiveThirtyEight was particularly known for this type of analysis, offering three different statistical prediction models and regularly posting stories breaking down polling minutiae, especially by demographic categories. However, few other versions gained the immediate response generated by this quick tweet, typo and all. What made these images so resonant that they were retweeted thousands of times and that so many variations circulated? One reason, we suggest, is that by tapping into the epideictic function of the visual and a particularly exigent communal concern over the composition of the national “we,” the tweets invited viewers on social media to actively visualize something they were already craving: ways to picture how the identity markers made salient by the politics of the moment collided with the identity constituting processes always at work in a U.S. presidential election. The maps were fertile ground for playing out those fundamentally epideictic questions, Who are we? (and what is wrong with them?).</p>
									<p>Both before and after the election, pretty much no one liked what they saw. Or, more accurately, in their pairings and contrasts, the maps provided many opportunities for projecting blame onto others alongside a circumference-drawing pride at any maps that showed one’s own preferred picture of the national electorate.</p>
									<p>In some right-wing circles, the circulation of Silver’s paired maps prompted vituperative circumference drawing along gender lines. The choices of women and men, pictured, reaffirmed masculine political  integrity and rekindled century-old assumptions about feminine political immaturity, even exhuming a dormant hashtag: #Repealthe19th. Though the hashtag reached viral proportions because it was used in response to conservative posts or offered up with tongue in cheek, original and sincere uses drew on the maps to not only blame women for a potential Clinton victory but also to assert that the proper voting public should not include women. One tweet responded to Silver’s map by noting that “women are not fit for politics.” Witnessing a political community divided along gendered lines, some viewers went from visualizing  “what a 15 point lead [among women] looks like” (“Electoral Map” 2016) to rethinking who ought to be included in their ideal community. The maps, in other words, weren’t functioning primarily as tools for data visualization but as “claims about the community [they address], about how it should view itself” and even be constituted (LaWare 1998, 144).</p>
									<p>Likewise, in the election’s aftermath, commentators on the left used these and similar maps to visualize communal failing. In maps showing voter demographics divided along both gender and race, white women in particular were called to witness their own complicity in Trump’s election and so realign their identifications for the future. Using data from FiveThirtyEight’s Swing-O-Matic visualized through 270towin.com, which was only one of the many freely available electoral map-making tools during the 2016 election, Ste Kinney-Fields expanded on the “If Only ___ Voted” format to include race and education as definable communities. In these, Kinney-Fields increased the options for visualizing the electorate, providing new visual resources for locating praise and blame.</p>

											<div class="col-8"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ch-3/3-xvoted.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
											<div class="col-2"></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>In particular, Kinney-Fields’ maps made clear that race, not gender, created the greatest disparity in voting. In fact, Kinney-Fields chose not to include iterations of the map that broke down how people of color vote by education and gender because “it was always 100% blue.”  These maps were then widely used to understand who was to blame for Trump’s electoral victory as well as invite communities into different relationships. In that use, the maps offered visions of community—gone wrong or gone right—not through “a clear and rational case” but by generating “a vivid picture of the shared definition” of who “we” are (Condit 1985, 292).</p>
									<p>Attending to these maps through an epideictic frame, rhetoricians are well equipped to understand how the purportedly factual visualizations of statistical information in these maps serves arguments about the flaws and possibilities of the nation, inviting viewers to witness not merely voter demographic information but assertions about their proper relationships to one another and the state. Recognizing the epideictic function at work also helps explain how the maps devolved as anxieties heightened, leading to satirical maps that kept the original concept but played to a collective sense of anxiety and lack of control. Maps like “Nuclear Waste,” with states on fire, buried in nuclear waste, or overtaken by “intelligent apes,” untethered blame from statistics, but remained tethered to both the shape of the nation and the epideictic underpinnings of more serious maps. <i>New York Magazine’s</i> tongue-in-cheek explainer of these maps captures the small comfort and solidarity this community found: “You don’t even have to limit yourself to a true physical shape of the United States … Welcome to 2016! Traditional politics as we knew them have basically gone to hell anyway!” (Kircher 2016). In their absurdity, these maps showed what was also true of the earlier ones: their rhetorical function was to witness the community and its feelings.</p>

									<p>Scholars studying the rhetorical force of citizenship have long warned that—because nations demand borders, with insiders and outsiders—any celebration of citizenship must be tempered by recognition of the harms that come with circumference drawing.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> Citizenship demands the existence of those who are not citizens. Therefore basing access to rights on access to citizenship likewise requires the existence of people without rights. The epideictic, as one of three options for rhetorical function in the Aristotelian frame, carries the same flaw. Building and sustaining communities through speech of praise and blame (or pictures of praise and blame) depends on praise for the insiders and blame for those who threaten them or, alternatively, a purging of that which is (or those who are) blameworthy within the community in order to regain the community’s true, praiseworth self. Community formation, via the epideictic, is a practice of circumference drawing. The epideictic function of the visual allows rhetoricians to notice how witnessing makes claims and strengthens identifications—“who we are.” It also functions within a framework where identification “is compensatory to division” and is a practice of division (Burke 1969, 22). It does not serve as well for imagining community formations that might move beyond us-and-them boundary drawing.</p>

									<h2>Fake News</h2>

								<section>
									<p>Anyone who has spent any time at all studying rhetoric knows that rhetoric has a bad reputation. From Plato’s denigration of rhetorical manipulations to contemporary dismissals of “mere rhetoric” and exhortations to turn from rhetoric to reality, “rhetoric” is associated with falsehood and spin. It’s about looks, not about the truth. Rhetoricians have long sought to protect our discipline from such smears, yet we must also admit: sometimes falsehood is more persuasive than the truth. While rhetorical manipulation might be most obviously harmful in deliberative and forensic spheres, where lies lead to bad policy decisions or erroneous convictions, it also plagues the epideictic. The “truths” of community formation may not be true, and blame need not be deserved in order to generate powerful, sometimes deadly, communal scapegoating.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

											<div class="col-2"></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>Outlining the epideictic function of the visual, then, requires grappling with the paradox that witnessing the truth of a community often has very little to do with the Truth. The cliché “a picture is worth a thousand words,” as we note in the introduction, invokes the indexical power of the visual and carries a pervasive sense that what is seen is connected to what is real. Despite the deep skepticism about visual information that pervades contemporary visual life, there remains a persistent and sticky tendency to link what is seen in a picture with what is real—particularly if what is seen already coincides with our pre-existing beliefs.</p>
									<p>Circulating primarily in conservative social media shortly after the 2016 election, the map-based infographic above compared 2016 voting results with 2013 crime rates. The two maps in the graphic both used red and blue, county-by-county breakdowns to show not only an overwhelming Trump vote but also a high correlation between Democratic voting and high crime rates. The graphic invited viewers to witness a truth about the nation and its people, establishing the rightness of Trump’s election by aligning his voters with moral rectitude and Clinton voters with criminality (and—by racist inference—Blackness). By looking at the maps next to each other, conservative viewers were invited to affirm their membership in the good and proper body of the nation.</p>
									<p>The graphic, however, is manipulative. Its data is falsely labeled, if not actually false. The map supposedly showing crime rates is actually just a 2012 county-by-county election map using the familiar red = Republican and blue = Democratic coding scheme. The two maps, in other words, show a high correlation between voting in 2012 and voting in 2016 rather than a [supposed] correlation between voting for Hilary Clinton and general moral failing. Despite its falsity, the map was epideictically effective. It circulated widely among right-leaning communities, showing what they felt to be true and therefore reaffirming a sense of investment in their pre-existing identity and of distance from the out-group.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> Even after the original poster removed the content, having learned it wasn’t accurate, the graphic continued to circulate as a meaningful truth. To go back to Condit’s assertion that the epideictic isn’t <i>only</i> about being accurate but also compelling, we might say that the epideictic need not be particularly accurate <i>at all.</i> In fact, none of the maps presented in this chapter relied on accuracy in order to achieve their community-sustaining, community-witnessing effects. Sources or data were not especially relevant to the work of building connections and allowing communities to visualize themselves. Instead, the mere sense of rightness lent to the maps by confirmation bias combined with shared understandings of  maps and infographics as truth-telling to allow the misleading graphic to witness a presumed truth about “us” and “them.” </p>
									<p>This realization about the epideictic power of a falsified graphic led us to a thought experiment which resulted in both the pictures immediately below and the pictures that open this chapter. What, we asked, would happen if we asked DALL-E (a picture-generating AI program made available for public use in 2022) to make epideictic maps for us? While this 2016 crime/election map might now be considered a “cheap fake”—a simple mislabeling of an image that could be accomplished with something as simple as MS Paint—DALL-E has been a headline-making example of how the tools for creating “deep fakes” are becoming both increasingly sophisticated and widely available.</p>

									<p>DALL-E “uses a technique called latent diffusion to learn associations between words and images,” drawing on what it can glean of common sense in order to generate pictures that evoke that common sense (Edwards 2022). To produce those pictures, a user simply enters a written prompt. After a brief work period, DALL-E responds, providing four pictures that synthesize what the AI has learned thanks to its “training” with millions of word-image pairings (Bouchard 2022). When we offered DALL-E the phrase “a picture worth a thousand words,” it provided us with AI-generated versions of stock photography: a bike path winding through palm trees beneath a brilliant blue sky; a dock, criss-crossed with shadows, reaching out into a placid lake; a prairie dotted with maple trees, brilliant in a fall sunset; a quiet river in the morning sun, reflecting tree-lined banks. In a way, DALL-E recognized the cliché rather than the meaning—offering us singularly mundane pictures. When we replaced the word “picture” in the prompt with “map,” things got more interesting. A map worth a thousand words might be covered in words—but it might also tellingly highlight places granted exceptional value in late capitalist common sense. DALL-E’s four proposed maps worth a thousand words appear above—a fitting, AI-derived representation of common sight.</p>

									<p>All of which brings us to two DALL-E prompts relevant to this section: “2016 election map if only women voted” and “2016 election map if only white people voted.” These maps, in their remarkable proximity to the “real” thing and in their amusing departures (e.g. the pink that predominates if only women voted and the ironic blankness of certain Midwestern and Plains states if only white people voted) do not tell us anything at all about election results. On the other hand, they tell us a great deal about how mapping communal identity—including what is perceivable as true and what feels palpably fake—is a matter of indexing and making common sense. Attending to the epideictic function of the visual, then, helps us understand how and why maps—even fake ones—wield public feeling. It also ought to help us notice that anxieties about realness, authenticity, and rightness are always deeply embedded in any epideictic appeal. </p>

									<h2>Future Past</h2>

									<p>Because epideictic rhetorical functions inevitably draw on well-established assumptions about what is right and authentic and because they rely heavily on beliefs about common pasts and common places, they have typically—and rightly—been understood as inherently conservative and normalizing. The epideictic “draws on customary symbols, topics, and rituals” (Richards 2009, 7) in order to unify audiences and invite identification. In the process, <i>custom</i> constrains what the community does, looks like, and imagines about its possible futures. The “we” constituted and addressed by epideictic discourse often begs the question of where that “we” comes from—how its past constrains its present and its future.</p>
									<p>Oddly, then, visual rhetoric scholarship relying on the epideictic functions of the visual has frequently treated them as liberatory, even revolutionary. Focusing most frequently on pictures and images produced within and for marginalized communities, this work emphasizes the epideictic’s invocation of what was in order to instantiate what ought to be. In essays on public art, the built environment, fashion, and more, the epideictic functions of the visual serve to provoke conversation, visualize alternative pasts and futures, and redraw communal borders.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">12</a></sup> Reclaiming pasts and emphasizing seemingly lost origin stories, this use of the epideictic in visual rhetoric has emphasized that neither borders nor communities are stagnant. Rather, they can be remade and recontextualized and the epideictic functions of the visual can aid in imagining and working toward more just futures. The epideictic may be conservative in its turn toward a presumed-common past, this scholarship suggests, but the visual also offers unique rhetorical resources for self-making and community change.</p>
									<p>And yet, we suggest, rhetoricians would do well to keep in mind the conservative, normalizing frameworks underlying the epideictic functions of the visual. Their “dorsal turn”—a moving forward by orienting backward—relies on definitions of communal bond that require shared pasts in order to envision shared futures (Willis 2008). When there is no shared past, over-reliance on epideictic frameworks might well lead rhetoricians and rhetors to imagine pasts that do not exist, appropriate others’ stories in order to build their own pasts, or resign themselves to a desolate future.</p>

									<p>Rhetorical scholars, pundits, and social media posters alike have spent a great deal of ink (and pixels) on the fictional past imagined in Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.” They note that the phrase mobilizes resentment, xenophobia, nostalgia, and white supremacy and demonstrate that the golden era invoked by the slogan is a fantasy. Even so, the communal vision focused by that fantasy carries extraordinary staying power. It generates images of normalcy and possibility that—for those on the inside—makes possible a deeply desired return to greatness in the present. Even if it is fake news, the America mapped out by making America great is exemplary of the work that epideictic frameworks do when they invite audiences to “bear witness to [their] historical legacy as well as [their] present” (LaWare 1998, 147).<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> As an analytical tool, the epideictic helps rhetoricians recognize what is happening in Trumpian visual culture. As a primary tool available for rhetoricians who seek to understand community formation, however, it risks over-emphasizing the need for a shared and celebratable past—one with minimal conflicts, clear boundaries, and mutually agreeable definitions. </p>
									<p>Appropriation is frequently a sub-function of the epideictic function of the visual, particularly in colonial contexts. Your place becomes our place; your past, our past (Ewalt 2011). That appropriative sub-function goes hand-in-hand with the invented pasts just discussed. It is audible and visible, for example, in the endless repetition of “This land is our land” and “Immigrants go home!” by white nationalist protestors over the years. National and world historic sites, likewise, frequently claim others’ space as commonplace, inviting publics to imagine themselves in light of a great, presumably shared past. National identities rooted in pre-Colombian sites, as Christa has detailed elsewhere, are exemplary of the erasures, conflations, theft, and violence often required by epideictic invocations of a shared past (C. Olson 2022). Here again, rhetoricians can effectively engage epideictic frameworks to name, analyze, and undermine such claims, but we must also be careful to name the appropriations at work even in largely liberatory  epideictic appeals and recognize that such appropriations are, if not inevitable, at least fundamentally constitutive of epideictic frameworks. Especially in settler colonial societies, a shared past is, inevitably, an appropriated past as well as a white-washed one.</p>

									<p>For that reason, the epideictic is not well suited for community making that does not rely on a shared or idealized past. Likewise, scholars approaching community formation via the epideictic might well miss modes of community formation that don’t look backward in order to shape the present and the future. As we end this chapter, then, we turn to another sort of map to invite reflection on visual rhetorical functions for community building beyond the epideictic. How might maps like those produced by Native Lands Digital, a geospatial visualization project where Indigenous communities “can represent themselves and their histories on their own terms” welcome settler rhetoricians into new frameworks for community that don’t require shared pasts? What might it look like, for example, to picture shared presents and futures among settlers, Indigenous people, and peoples whose ancestors were brought to the Americas against their will without appropriating a mythic Indigenous past or an imaginary shared space?</p>
									<p>On the one hand, the maps produced by Native Lands Digital are presented in epideictic terms. The maps are intended to “better facilitate self-representation” of Indigenous nations and peoples and enhance “narratives that combat colonialism.” The map provides several ways to understand the relationships between spaces and communities. Users can toggle on and off various types of boundaries, including territories, languages, and treaties. When those boundaries are visible, the Native Lands map simultaneously participates in and co opts the familiar visual force of the epideictic. The lines drawn around communities are different from the ones that contemporary US viewers expect to see laid out across the territory they likely perceive as the United States. State boundaries are missing, replaced with overlapping color fields that articulate Indigenous space and pose a distinctly different orientation toward the landmass now known as North America. And yet, viewing this map and its reimagination of space in terms of the epideictic ultimately means maintaining a Western frame for how the map functions visually and rhetorically. Settlers engaging with the map project often use it in order to picture <i>the</i> past of <i>our</i> place—to tell a story about the lands we occupy and the people who preceded us. Preparing for land acknowledgements rather than decolonial engagement, we <i>phantasize</i> and appropriate a shared past to authorize present action.</p>

									<p>Seeing the map as a means of epideictic community formation relies on habits of circumference drawing that presume at least temporary fixity of location and of membership. Whether what is pictured is a Westphalian nation-state or a Native nation, an epideictic orientation typically presumes that the community pre-exists rhetoric even as it is formed by rhetoric. It encourages viewers and analysts to treat the spatial organization depicted as something real and natural. It connects past to present. In the process, even when visual epideictic intends to undercut that which has been treated as normal or natural (e.g. the shape of the United States), there's a tendency to replicate the strategy, merely naming new pasts, drawing new borders and delineating new circumferences that will replace the old ones with better divisions between us and them.</p>
									<p>If the epideictic’s “dorsal turn” asks us to look for something in common behind us, then it is not well equipped for imagining community today in the context of violent, fraught, pasts. Kyle Powys Whyte (2017), Zoe Todd (2016), and Simón Yampara (2016), along with numerous other Indigneous scholars have made this point repeatedly—though not specifically about the epideictic. They note that our present condition of ecological injustice and climate collapse—and their inequitable impact—is not the result of a shared past but a specifically divergent one that was driven by Western white supremacist, capitalist, extractive colonialism. Our present is formed by histories of violence, exclusion, and theft, and imagining community by envisioning a shared past inevitably downplays that destruction. What might it look like, not to wipe the slate clean or ignore those histories of violence, but to identify rhetorical functions of the visual that enable uncommon but just, communal futures? We don’t think the epideictic gets us there, and we invite rhetoricians to picture new ways of “sighting the public.”</p>
